description: Understanding the built-in polyfills in react-native-webworker.
---

The `react-native-webworker` library includes built-in polyfills to provide essential web APIs that are missing from Hermes. Every worker automatically gets these polyfills loaded before your code runs.

## Why are polyfills needed?

Hermes is a lightweight JavaScript engine optimized for React Native, but it doesn't implement all the standard Web APIs that you might expect in a browser environment (like Chrome's V8 or Safari's JavaScriptCore).

To ensure that standard libraries and isomorphic code work correctly, `react-native-webworker` injects a set of polyfills into the worker environment.

## Included polyfills

Currently, the following APIs are polyfilled:

- **AbortController**: Allows you to abort asynchronous operations (like fetch requests).
- **TextEncoder / TextDecoder**: For encoding and decoding strings to/from binary data.

*(More polyfills will be added in future versions)*

## Adding new polyfills

If you are contributing to the library, you can extend the polyfill bundle by adding new APIs:

1.  Install the polyfill package in `packages/polyfills`:
    ```bash
    cd packages/polyfills
    yarn add text-encoding-polyfill
    ```

2.  Import it in the source file:
    ```javascript
    // packages/polyfills/src/index.js
    import 'abort-controller/polyfill';
    import 'text-encoding-polyfill';  // New polyfill
    ```

3.  Rebuild the polyfills:
    ```bash
    cd packages/polyfills
    yarn build
    ```

The new polyfill will be automatically available in all workers.
