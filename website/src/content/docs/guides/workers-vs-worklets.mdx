title: Workers vs. Worklets
description: Understand the difference between Web Workers and Reanimated Worklets.
---

It is important to distinguish between **Worklets** (used by Reanimated, VisionCamera, etc.) and **Web Workers** (this library).

| Feature | Worklets | Web Workers (This library) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | **Callbacks**: High-frequency, specialized logic (Animations, Sensors, Video). | **Computation**: Persistent offloading of CPU-intensive business logic. |
| **Lifecycle** | **Short-lived**: Usually invoked for specific events or frames. | **Persistent**: Long-running threads that maintain internal state. |
| **Execution** | Often tied to the UI thread or specific specialized threads. | True parallelism on dedicated background threads. |
| **Standard** | Custom React Native concepts (Runtime/Worklet). | **W3C Web Standard** (`postMessage`, `onmessage`). |
| **Compatibility** | Native-only. | **Isomorphic** (runs on Web and Native). |

## When to use what?

### Use `react-native-webworker` when:
- You need to process large datasets (filtering, sorting, mapping).
- You are performing complex mathematical calculations or encryption.
- You need code that runs exactly the same on React Native and the Web.
- You need a persistent background task that manages its own state over time.

### Use Worklets when:
- You are driving animations (Reanimated).
- You are processing camera frames in real-time (VisionCamera).
- You need synchronous communication with the UI thread for gesture handling.
